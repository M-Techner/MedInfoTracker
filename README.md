### Medical Information Tracker

### Overview
We've all been there - for one reason or another, you have to see a new doctor (or worse, you're in an emergency situation) and you have to fill out 
the multitude of forms about your medical history. Time to rack your brain and begin the google searches. What was the date of that surgery? What was 
that dosage again? What about those of us with chronic illness and medical conditions? Tracking symptoms can help sufferers find patterns and avoid 
triggering events. Being able to accurately monitor and track your medical information is incredibly important - your life may actually depend on it. 

We're creating an application that will be your go-to for storing and accessing your personal medical data, including: a comprehensive profile, symptom 
tracking, medication tracking, emergency contact information, and the ability to set calendar reminders for prescription refills and medical appointments. 
Further, this application will require user registration and login credentials, as well as be responsive across multiple platforms (laptop, tablet, and 
mobile). 

The members of our group either have or know of someone who has chronic illness and medical conditions. The idea for this application came out of our own 
frustration with having to fill out medical histories/information over and over again, stressing every time to ensure accuracy. By having one central, 
secure location where users can update, upload and easily access their personal medical information, we want to help reduce at least a little of the 
stress of having to meet with a new doctor.
